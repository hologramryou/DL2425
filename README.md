GROUP 29 DEEP LEARNING

Step 1: Prepared the dataset into 2 parts, train and validate and place them into their types of folders

Step 2: Check your GPUs, if you have, you can run the hardcore training. I only have a MacBook Pro so I prefer to use normal training one (which does not have data augmentation)

Step 3: Run the training file, it will export the model that you can use for longterm to do remote sensing pictures.

Step 4: Change the path of the image and model, then run

Step 5: Voila, You have got the prediction of the image you choose
